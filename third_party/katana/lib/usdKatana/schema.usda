        \\ref UsdShadeLook::SetBaseLook() "SetBaseLook()"), it seems natural to
        think about a "child" that inherits from its base Look "parent".
        However, in USD, the derived Look cannot be a child of the base Look
        because the \\em derives relationship would cause an infinite
        recursion in the composition graph (because the derived Look must
        inherit not just the base Look prim itself, but all of the shader and
        other prims scoped underneath it, which would include the derived Look
        itself).

        For UI's that want to present the hierarchy that derivation implies,
        we provide \\em primName, which specifies the derived Look's 
        "relative name" with respect to the base Look.

        For example, a structure that looks like:
        - Metal
          - .. Brass
          - .. Aluminum

        will be encoded as
        - Metal
        - Metal_Brass
        - Metal_Aluminum

        We set derivedName on Metal_Brass and Metal_Aluminum to Brass and
        Aluminum, to be able to have proper child names if the hierarchy
        is reconstructed.
